This is webpage WIP for R24 ground Control
View the site at https://dagaayush1205.github.io/Ground-Control-for-R24/

The main obejctive of this page to display data received from the rover during the run
and display it to the to driver midst the run or simply display on the status of the 
rover during autonomous runs. 

Certain improvements that I would like to work on the future is to:
1. Give the page a more interactive and modern look.
2. To add a local map of the surrounding and display unexplored areas.
3.
